# Under Construction
# socks5-server-interface
This is a SOCKS5 server partial implementation. 
Unlike SOCKS5 servers, it doesn't dial outbound connection itself, but lets you to connect the inbound with outbound, or just denies the request. Similiar to v2ray-core. 

# Features (Or, limitations)
- NOAUTH only (for quite a long time)
- CONNECT only (for quite a time, not sure)
